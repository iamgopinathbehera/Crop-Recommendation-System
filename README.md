## Overview
This project provides a simple, user-friendly interface for farmers and agricultural experts to get crop recommendations based on:
- Nitrogen content
- Phosphorus content
- Potassium content
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH value
- Rainfall

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean and user-friendly design for easy parameter input
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant crop recommendations using machine learning
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 99.54% accuracy using Random Forest algorithm
- **Environmental Parameters**: Comprehensive analysis of soil and climate conditions

## Model Performance
We evaluated several machine learning models and achieved the following accuracy scores:

| Model | Accuracy |
|------------------------|-----------------| 
| Logistic Regression | 96.06% |
| Naive Bayes | 99.39% |
| SVC | 98.33% |
| KNN | 97.57% |
| Decision Tree | 98.03% |
| Random Forest | **99.54%** |
| Bagging | 98.94% |
| AdaBoost | 21.21% |

The Random Forest model was selected for its superior accuracy of 99.54%.

## Technologies Used
